The paper proceeds in two steps. First, we construct a Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) model of a primary commodity exporting developing country calibrated to Ghana and Uganda and simulate the impulse response to shocks to the oil price and oil production. Second, using parameters from the DSGE model to obtain priors for parameter values, we use a Structural Vector Autoregressive (SVAR) with monthly data over 2001 to 2019 to estimate the response to oil shocks as an importer for both countries and as an exporter for Ghana after 2010. The DSGE results suggest that although an oil price shock generates appreciation and initially output falls, there are reductions in interest rates and inflation and ultimately output increases. The larger the oil sector the greater the appreciation and inflationary effects, but output rises more quickly and there are larger increases in wages and taxes. The SVAR results for Ghana when exporting suggest an initial depreciation in response to an oil price shock, with a reduction in inflation, but the immediate negative output response slowly turns positive (and becomes consistent with the DSGE). When Ghana and Uganda are importers, oil price shocks generate appreciation, mild inflation and interest rate reductions, so although output declines initially it rises after a year and this persists. The analysis suggests that the adoption of inflation targeting, in conjunction with an improved monitoring of macroeconomic developments, has mitigated the effects of oil price shocks on domestic variables in Ghana and Uganda.\n","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"40bd760aca77838661cb116d38e7eef1","permalink":"https://larsspreng.github.io/project/oil_ms/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/oil_ms/","section":"project","summary":"This paper provides analysis of the macroeconomic management implications of becoming an exporter of oil, taking the case of Ghana and applying to Uganda as a prospective exporter.

Most macroeconomic models predict that aid inflows, especially if large and/or unanticipated (shocks), will lead to an appreciation of the real exchange rate and undermine the competitiveness of the economy. Empirical evidence is inconclusive, but a common presumption is that aid has been associated with Dutch Disease effects in SSA. Previous empirical studies rely on annual data and few include data since the mid-2000s. This paper focuses on the more recent period employing monthly time series data for ten countries over 2001 to 2017 to estimate a structural VAR. For the majority of countries aid has no or a minimal effect on the real exchange rate; there is evidence of a significant real appreciation in only two countries. Additional analysis shows that commodity export prices are a more important determinant of the real exchange rate, with an effect on average twice that of aid. The paper conjectures that the absence of a Dutch Disease effect since the 2000s is due to a declining level of aid inflows and improved macroeconomic management.\n","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"0569ee24e27c73fecc2da87a1ad3249b","permalink":"https://larsspreng.github.io/project/aid_rsm/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/aid_rsm/","section":"project","summary":"Given the significant inflows of foreign aid to sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) the possibility of Dutch Disease has been a concern.
