The paper proceeds in two steps. First, we construct a Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) model of a primary commodity exporting developing country calibrated to Ghana and Uganda and simulate the impulse response to shocks to the oil price and oil production. Second, using parameters from the DSGE model to obtain priors for parameter values, we use a Structural Vector Autoregressive (SVAR) with monthly data over 2001 to 2019 to estimate the response to oil shocks as an importer for both countries and as an exporter for Ghana after 2010. The DSGE results suggest that although an oil price shock generates appreciation and initially output falls, there are reductions in interest rates and inflation and ultimately output increases. The larger the oil sector the greater the appreciation and inflationary effects, but output rises more quickly and there are larger increases in wages and taxes. The SVAR results for Ghana when exporting suggest an initial depreciation in response to an oil price shock, with a reduction in inflation, but the immediate negative output response slowly turns positive (and becomes consistent with the DSGE). When Ghana and Uganda are importers, oil price shocks generate appreciation, mild inflation and interest rate reductions, so although output declines initially it rises after a year and this persists. The analysis suggests that the adoption of inflation targeting, in conjunction with an improved monitoring of macroeconomic developments, has mitigated the effects of oil price shocks on domestic variables in Ghana and Uganda.","tags":["Development Economics","Exchange Rates"],"title":"Macroeconomic Management on Becoming an African Oil Exporter","type":"project"},{"authors":["Eric Hillebrand","Jakob G Mikkelsen","Lars Spreng","Giovanni Urga"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1575158400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1575158400,"objectID":"4a4e4a50a3a36bdc149c02e5303c4e88","permalink":"https://larsspreng.github.io/project/fx_hmsu/","publishdate":"2019-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/fx_hmsu/","section":"project","summary":"We examine the relationship between exchange rates and macroeconomic fundamentals using a two-step maximum likelihood estimator through which we compute time-varying factor loadings. Factors are obtained as principal components, extracted from a large macro-dataset. Using 14 currencies over 1995â€“2018, we show that the loadings on the factors vary considerably over time with frequent sign changes. Allowing for time-varying loadings increases the percentage of explained variation in exchanges rates by an order of magnitude. Accounting for instabilities improves the predictive ability of the model globally and locally during crises, and yields better forecast of sign changes in exchange rates.","tags":["Exchange Rates","Forecasting"],"title":"Exchange Rates and Macroeconomic Fundamentals -- Evidence of Instabilities from Time-Varying Factor Loadings","type":"project"},{"authors":["Oliver Morrissey","Lionel Roger","Lars Spreng"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"0569ee24e27c73fecc2da87a1ad3249b","permalink":"https://larsspreng.github.io/project/aid_rsm/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/aid_rsm/","section":"project","summary":"","tags":["Development Economics","Exchange Rates"],"title":"Aid and Exchange Rates in sub-Saharan Africa --  No More Dutch Disease?","type":"project"},{"authors":["Lars Spreng"],"categories":["Demo"],"content":"Example Post  Example post  ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"279b9966ca9cf3121ce924dca452bb1c","permalink":"https://larsspreng.github.io/post/getting-started/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/getting-started/","section":"post","summary":"test post summary","tags":["Academic"],"title":"First Blog Post","type":"post"}]
